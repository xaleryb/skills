"""Fetch the subtree an imported skill's pin names, not the repository around it.

`sync_external.py`, which generates an imported skill's directory from its pin and
`--check`s that the two still agree, needs the files under one directory at one
commit. The obvious way to get them, and the way it did get them, is
`codeload.github.com/<repo>/tar.gz/<commit>`: one request, no token, every byte under
the pin.

That does not scale, and the cost is not in the skill. It is in the repository the
skill lives in. Measured against the repositories this catalog already imports from
and the kind it will import from next:

    intel/gpu-ai-skills            383 KB repo ->    248 KB tarball
    intel/scikit-learn-intelex      46 MB repo ->   11.6 MB tarball
    NVIDIA/cuda-quantum            2.0 GB repo ->    113 MB tarball, for one skill

A catalog of a few hundred skills is a catalog sourced from product repositories, not
from a handful of skill repositories: NVIDIA's 343 skills come from 38 upstreams
totalling 7.7 GB. Tarball transport makes every pull request download that and hold
each uncompressed tree in memory while it works.

A blobless single-revision partial clone with a non-cone sparse checkout moves the
subtree and nothing else:

    NVIDIA/cuda-quantum, one subtree -> 3.2 MB transferred, ~50 MB peak RSS

The trade is real and small in the other direction: for a repository that is already
just skills, the tarball is one HTTP GET while this is a git negotiation with
server-side blob filtering, and intel/gpu-ai-skills measures ~2.4 s here against
~0.6 s there. Paying two seconds per upstream to stop downloading gigabytes per
upstream is the right side of that trade, and it is one code path rather than two.

`check_upstream.py` uses the same transport to ask whether a pinned directory changed
upstream: `commit_trees` fetches trees only, no blobs, and `subtree_hashes` compares ids.

Bytes come from the object store (`ls-tree` + `cat-file`), not from the working tree:
a `.gitattributes` with `text`/`eol` or a clean/smudge filter would otherwise let the
checkout hand back something other than what upstream committed, and what this
repository vendors is a statement about upstream's bytes. `ls-tree` is also where the
mode comes from, so the recorded execute bit does not depend on the umask of whoever
ran the tool.
